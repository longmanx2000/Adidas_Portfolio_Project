# Adidas U.S. Sales Performance Analysis

## üìä Project Background

This project analyzes Adidas U.S. sales data to uncover the key factors driving the sharp sales spike at the start of 2021 and the sustained growth that followed throughout the year. It also identifies the most profitable regions, sales methods, and retailers by examining metrics such as **Total Sales**, **Units Sold**, **Average Price per Unit (APU/AOV)**, and **Average Revenue per Unit (ARPU)**.

As a data analyst working at **Adidas U.S.**, the goal is to determine whether the company‚Äôs sales growth was primarily influenced by **price changes**, **volume increases**, or **regional and channel performance**, and to provide actionable insights for maintaining long-term profitability.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Regional Performance**
- **Product Pricing & Demand Trends**
- **Sales Channel Insights**
- **Retailer Performance**

üîó *The Excel and Power BI files used for this analysis will be available here once uploaded.*

## üìà Executive Summary

The analysis revealed that while overall sales growth was largely driven by a nationwide surge in 2021, regional, channel, and retailer dynamics played critical roles. The **West region** led the early-year spike, while later months saw record highs in the **South** and **Northeast**, showing a shift in consumer demand.

In terms of channels, **Online sales** generated the highest total revenue due to volume, while **In-store sales** achieved the highest **Average Revenue per Unit (ARPU)**, reflecting premium customer behavior. Among retailers, **West Gear** emerged as the dominant force behind the January 2021 surge, maintaining the highest total sales and ARPU overall.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Caveats and Assumptions

**Assumption 1:** The dataset lacks **Order ID**, so **Average Price per Unit (APU)** was used as a **proxy for Average Order Value (AOV)** ‚Äî representing *Average Revenue per Unit*.  

**Assumption 2:** **Operating Profit and Margin** calculations were excluded due to **invalid or missing data** in roughly 40% of entries.  

**Assumption 3:** **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** and **ROI** could not be calculated, as required marketing and spend data were unavailable.
